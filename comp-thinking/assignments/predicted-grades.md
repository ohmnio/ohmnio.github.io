# Observations RE Predicted Grades Debacle

Scenario
--------

### Problem Statement

Leaving Cert. student evaluations cannot take place as ordinarily specified due to restrictions put in place in response to critical viral outbreak.

### Causes

- Restrictions introduced to reduce transmission of the virus require students to remain at home during the period covering the final school term and examinations leading to:
  - Closure of all schools.
  - Cancellation of all examinations.
  
### Ramifications

- Closure of schools will negativly impact the proper provision of:
  - Teaching for the remaining curriculum.
  - Support for the completion of any project-based or coursework assignments.
  - Student preparation for any alternative testing arrangements that may be put in place. 
- Student/teacher contact over a crucial period leading upto student evaluations cannot be garunteed to take place to the usual standard.
- Crucial final examinations will not take place.

### Outcomes

- An alternative to the standard program of student evaluations is required.

### Response

- Any alternative program must provide for:
  - The need of students to represent their fitness to progress academically or vocationally.
  - The need of education and industry to assess students for placement.
- Any alternative program must account for:
  - The impossibility to stage examinations.
  - Lack of student support for:
    - Learning for the ramainder of the curriculum.
    - Completion of assignments.
    - Preparation for any alternative program of testing.
  - The lack of student/teacher contact over the crucial final school term.
  - The broader impact of the pandemic situation on the ability of students to properly represent their abilities and potential.
  - Socio-economic and interpersonal factors involved in assessing young adults in terms that may greatly impact their future progression.
  
Analysis
--------

- Investigation into a suitable alternative program begins with analysis of existing program.  
  
### Purpose

- Produce metrics by which students can:
  - Be evaluated for placement onto programs by education and training institutions.
  - Be evaluated for job/internship/training placement by employers.
  - Evaluate their own performace and abilities to inform their decisions about their future development and progression.
  - Contribute to their sense of self worth and value to society.

### Stakeholders

- Central stakeholders:
  - Students.
- Immediate Stakeholders:
  - Schools.
  - HSE.
- Forward stakeholders:
  - Higher education institutions.
  - Vocational training providers.
  - Employers.

### Use Cases

- Higher education:
  - Subject specific minimum entry requirements.
  - Points system.
- Employers & vocational training:
  - Ad hoc basic competancy measures.
  - Indicative of key skills.

### Context

- There is an expectation of scarsity of desirable places in education and positions in employment.
- Rigid organisation of education and variablility in job markets reduces ease of mobility among positions.
  - High importance placed on getting the right position first time.
- It is highly desired that school graduates only be permmitted entrance in to positions where there is minimal likleyhood of failure to complete a given program or meet the requirements of a given position.
  - It is percieved that minimising failure increases overall efficientcy.
  - Information produced by a failed placement is not considered valuable.
  - This position is exaserbated by expectation of scarcity of places and poor mobility.
- It is highly desired that assessments be fair and impartial.
  - Only an issue in context of scarcity.

### Approach

- Curriculum is divided into separate subjects.
- Students take a range of subjects.
  - Some reqired and some optional.
- Metrics align with curriculum organisation.
  - A single grade representing level of attainment per each academic subject.
- Collection of subject grades constitute students Leaving Cert. results to be provided as basis for future evaluations.

### Method

- Subject grades determined by some combination of:
  - Final examination results.
  - Coursework assignment marks. 
- Impartiality acheived by:
  - Independence of assessment.
- Standardisation acheived by:
  - Alignment of curriculum and criterion.
  - Centralisation of evaluation.

### Assumptions

- Subject grades are a good measure of specific knowledge attainmnet and subject competancy.
  - _For progression into further subject specialisation modelled on the same principals as Leaving Cert curriculum, subject grades seem a reasonable measure._
  - _In practice the subject specific knowledge attained at school level is neither advanced enough to confer benefits of specialisation or practically applicable enough to be of general use._
  - _First year higher education courses typically assume little retention of prior aquisition. Consider mature student placement._
- Subject grades are a good measure of the general competancies, key skills and/or soft skills required by the subject.
  - _There are many competancies and skills which my be employed by a student in approach to any given subject._
  - _All information about the approach a student employs is flattened into a single grade and effectively lost._
  - _Possible approaches a student may take to establishing competancy are norrowed towards a single point of final assessment._
  - _Skills involved in examination taking and assignment writing are the only general skills captured within the grade._
- Aggregation of subject grades can produce a good measure of general academic competantcey (vis-a-vis points system) or basic competantcey in the workplace (vis-a-vis ad hoc employer interpretations).
  - Aggregation of grades further discards information about the actual abilities of the student and flattens the information to a single point score or pass/fail tally.

### Vulnerabilities

- Heavy reliance on end of year final assessments:
  - Any disruption to provision of assessments liable to be catastrophic.
- Unresponsive to changing employment, technological, developmental and social contexts.
  - Risks committing students to developmental regime ill suited to the world they will inhabit.

### Undrelying Models

- To further explore the existing program, it's assumptions and vulnerabilities, we shall attempt to identify models which explain these aspects of the program and examin them for insights.

#### The Aligned Affixed Destiny Model

- A model of personal development.
- Understands the student as having inate talents, competancies and proclivities which are initially nacent and opaic.
- By engaging the student in particular forms of activities, these nacent aspects of their character will emerge, become embedded and be identifable. 
- The more closely the students course of study can be aligned with thier individual character, the more productive, successful and happy the student will be.
- Activities can be selected so as to encourage the desirable aspects to preferencially develop.
- By this mode of development, the student can continue to aquire mastery over increasingly specialised domains. Affixing their alignment to a field.
- Eventually the student will be satisfied they are ready to apply their skills to productive work.
- They will enter the workforce into a field which aligns with their character and ability and work over the remainder of their carrer to advance vertically within their chosen field. 
- Thus fulfilling their destiny.

#### Self Maximising Individual Specialist Model

- A model for design of educational programs in response to the Aligned Affixed Destiny model of personal development and it's intersection with 19th/20th century modes of productive activity.
- Oriented towards a mechanistic view of industry whereby workers are provisioned in terms of replacable components, specialised as required, crystalising in the form of the "job".
- Embeds the competitive nature of the jobs market.
- Isolates students by defining success purely in terms of their individual attainment.
- Obligates students to engage, to the fullest of their ability, in competition with their peers by nationally gaged standards, with a program which is imposed upon them, and to accept the concequences of their performance as measured only in terms of the criteron it deems correct.

Aetiology of The Crisis
-----------------------

### The Grading System

- An outgrowth of an education system consieved in terms of the models identified above.
- An attempt to simplify the complex branching transition phase of progression at the end of secondary education.  
- Adopts the role of categorising and sorting students in terms it deems appropriate to the needs of both industry and continued education.
- Forms a single gateway through which students must pass only at the end of their course of education.
- Captures very limited metrics and does so in a single pass.
- A single sample of a function which assumes a linear progression in all cases.
- Provides an algebra of student attainment.

### Predicted Grades

- As argued above, the grading system is a process by which we attempt to produce an impoverished measure of that resulting from a chaotic interplay of variables, of which we don't have a good understanding, predicated on a flawed model of attainment which assumes a linear progression in all cases.
- In the absence of the pivotal method of assessment we asked teachers to generate a specific and precise grade for each of their students, so as to conform to the expected output of the usual process, and to do so while accounting for their own internal biases.
- To maintain impartiality, we asked teachers to surpress their own self interest, upon which the model underlying their own advancement in the workforce is predicated, and their desire for their own students to be successfull (a triat we should arguabley be activily facilitating).
- Any data available to inform their predictions was not generated with the expectation to be employed in such a manner.

### Statistical/Aggregative Massaging

- Given that the teacher's predicted grades must be considered to lack accuracy, impartiality and uniformity of standard, a standardisation process, involving adjustment of some/all grades was deemed nessasary.
- As argued above, aggregation of an individual students grades serves to further obfuscate the actual abilities of the student.
- Standardisation requires some form of aggregation accross classes, subjects and/or schools. Reliability of the grades awared to any individual student can only be reduced by such processing.
- Any processing performed accross the set of predicited grades can only serve to further remove the individual grades from the truth of the situation on the ground. - There was never going to be a good way to do this (garbage in, garbage out). 

### The Coding Error

- In common language, a "coding error" suggests something sufficiently complex that errors can be expected to occurr.
- This did not rise to the standard of a coding error.

Components of Evaluation
------------------------

### Mastery

- Mastery: Attainment of a subject, topic or skill, to a level sufficient to apply the knowledge or ability gained in a productive or useful way.
- Attainment: Demonstable accumulated aquisition.
- Aquisition: 
  - Knowledge: Understanding and retention of information so as to be able to __apply it in relevant situations__.
  - Skill: Retained ability to apply a skill and to __recognise suitable opportunities to do so__.
- Mastery strategy: Strategy, or combination of, adobpted by a student in order to maximise efficient aquisition.
  - Linear aquisition
  - Backloaded aquisition (cramming)
  - Frontloaded aquisition (binging)
  - Repeated spaced exposure

### Subject/Topic Substructure

- Most subjects some combination of:
  - Linear Accumulitive
    - History
    - Geography
  - Compounding Accumulitive
    - Mathematics
    - Science Theory
  - Applicitive/Explorative
    - English
    - Literature
  - Skill Developmental
    - Art
    - Music
  - Practical
    - Science Practicals
    - PE
- __Different substructures suited to different mastery strategies.__

### Modes of provision:

- Directed provision: One-way mode where the form and content is preset and statically delivered.
  - Textbook followed in linear progression.
  - Static exposition
    - Lecture
    - Presentation
- Guided provision (explorative): Multi-way mode of provision where the students are able to guide the delivery so as to address their interests and needs.
  - Textbook available for topic reference.
  - Searchable indexes.
  - Dynamic exposition:
    - Q&A session.
    - Tutorials.
    - Office hours.
- Self-Directed provision: Open access to directed forms of provision

- __Different modes suited to different mastery strategies and subject/topic substructures.__

### Disciplins vs Subjects

- ???

### Multidisciplinary Projects

- Assigning a student to a project which they do not have the knowledge or skills to complete encourages them to:
  - Identity and engage with other students and their teachers who have the tools to help or contribute.
  - Actively seekout and aquire the knowledge or skills they need.
  - Employ problem solving strategies and seek novel approaches to find solutions.
- Problems requiring a multidisciplinary approach allow students to practice:
  - Gathering and synthesising different kinds of information.
  - Recognising novel opportunities to apply skills and knowledge they have previously aquired.
  
Summary
-------

Hopefully the outcome of these detailed observations will be to recognise that we dont need to employ an alternative program to maintain the existing grading scheme during this crisis. Indeed by seeing the flaws exposed by this crisis and acting to discard the scheme, along with its flawed assumptions and outdated models, we have an opportunity to fundamentally reorient education around the deeper richer understanding of personal development, productivity and success we have today. 

- As early as the 1950s/60s [Marshall McLuhan understood that the world of work was going to reorient from 'job holding' towards 'role playing'](https://youtu.be/mde_pXrEqBk). I propose we hear the echo of his words in the world around us today.

Tweetable Summary
-----------------

Grades are bullshit and eveyone has known it for a long time. In a do or die world we all engage with the fight that's in front of us. Where the power to change the system rests with those who have been well served by it, radical change becomes a matter of response to crisis. Well weWe're living through a crisis in a radically changing world.
