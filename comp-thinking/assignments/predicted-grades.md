Observations
============

Scenario
--------

### Problem Statement

Leaving Cert. student evaluations cannot take place as ordinarily specified due to restrictions put in place in response to critical viral outbreak.

### Causes

- Restrictions introduced to reduce transmission of the virus require students to remain at home during the period covering the final school term and examinations leading to:
  - Closure of all schools.
  - Cancellation of all examinations.

### Ramifications

- Closure of schools will negatively impact the proper provision of:
  - Teaching for the remaining curriculum.
  - Support for the completion of any project-based or coursework assignments.
  - Student preparation for any alternative testing arrangements that may be put in place. 
- Student/teacher contact over a crucial period leading up to student evaluations cannot be guaranteed to take place to the usual standard.
- Crucial final examinations will not take place.

### Outcomes

- An alternative to the standard program of student evaluations is required.

### Response

- Any alternative program must provide for:
  - The need of students to represent their fitness to progress academically or vocationally.
  - The need of education and industry to assess students for placement.
- Any alternative program must account for:
  - The impossibility to stage examinations.
  - Lack of student support for:
    - Learning for the remainder of the curriculum.
    - Completion of assignments.
    - Preparation for any alternative program of testing.
  - The lack of student/teacher contact over the crucial final school term.
  - The broader impact of the pandemic situation on the ability of students to properly represent their abilities and potential.
  - Socio-economic and interpersonal factors involved in assessing young adults in terms that may greatly impact their future progression.

Analysis
--------

Analysis of existing program to inform further observations.  

### Purpose

- Produce metrics by which students can:
  - Be evaluated for placement onto programs by education and training institutions.
  - Be evaluated for job/internship/training placement by employers.
  - Evaluate their own performance and abilities to inform their decisions about their future development and progression.
  - Contribute to their sense of self worth and value to society.

### Stakeholders

- Central stakeholders:
  - Students.
- Immediate Stakeholders:
  - Schools.
  - HSE.
- Forward stakeholders:
  - Higher education institutions.
  - Vocational training providers.
  - Employers.

### Use Cases

- Higher education:
  - Subject specific minimum entry requirements.
  - Points system.
- Employers & vocational training:
  - Ad hoc basic competency measures.
  - Indicative of key skills.

### Context

- There is an expectation of scarcity of desirable places in education and positions in employment.
- Rigid organisation of education and variability in job markets reduces ease of mobility among positions.
  - High importance placed on getting the right position first time.
- It is highly desired that school graduates only be permitted entrance in to positions where there is minimal likelihood of failure to complete a given program or meet the requirements of a given position.
  - It is perceived that minimising failure increases overall efficiency.
  - Information produced by a failed placement is not considered valuable.
  - This position is exacerbated by expectation of scarcity of places and poor mobility.
- It is highly desired that assessments be fair and impartial.
  - Only an issue in context of scarcity.

### Approach

- Curriculum is divided into separate subjects.
- Students take a range of subjects.
  - Some required and some optional.
- Metrics align with curriculum organisation.
  - A single grade representing level of attainment per each academic subject.
- Collection of subject grades constitute students Leaving Cert. results to be provided as basis for future evaluations.

### Method

- Subject grades determined by some combination of:
  - Final examination results.
  - Coursework assignment marks. 
- Impartiality achieved by:
  - Independence of assessment.
- Standardisation achieved by:
  - Alignment of curriculum and criterion.
  - Centralisation of evaluation.

### Assumptions

- Subject grades are a good measure of specific knowledge attainment and subject competency.
  - _For progression into further subject specialisation modelled on the same principals as Leaving Cert curriculum, subject grades seem a reasonable measure._
  - _In practice the subject specific knowledge attained at school level is neither advanced enough to confer benefits of specialisation or practically applicable enough to be of general use._
  - _First year higher education courses typically assume little retention of prior acquisition. Consider mature student placement._
- Subject grades are a good measure of the general competencies, key skills and/or soft skills required by the subject.
  - _There are many competencies and skills which my be employed by a student in approach to any given subject._
  - _All information about the approach a student employs is flattened into a single grade and effectively lost._
  - _Possible approaches a student may take to establishing competency are narrowed towards a single point of final assessment._
  - _Skills involved in examination taking and assignment writing are the only general skills captured within the grade._
- Aggregation of subject grades can produce a good measure of general academic competency (vis-a-vis points system) or basic competency in the workplace (vis-a-vis ad hoc employer interpretations).
  - Aggregation of grades further discards information about the actual abilities of the student and flattens the information to a single point score or pass/fail tally.

### Vulnerabilities

- Heavy reliance on end of year final assessments:
  - Any disruption to provision of assessments liable to be catastrophic.
- Unresponsive to changing employment, technological, developmental and social contexts.
  - Risks committing students to developmental regime ill suited to the world they will inhabit.

### Underlying Models

- To further explore the existing program, it's assumptions and vulnerabilities, we shall attempt to identify models which explain these aspects of the program and examine them for insights.

#### Aligned Affixed Destiny Model

- A model of personal development.
- Understands the student as having innate talents, competencies and proclivities which are initially nascent and opaque.
- By engaging the student in particular forms of activities, these nascent aspects of their character will emerge, become embedded and be identifiable. 
- The more closely the students course of study can be aligned with their individual character, the more productive, successful and happy the student will be.
- Activities can be selected so as to encourage the desirable aspects to preferentially develop.
- By this mode of development, the student can continue to acquire mastery over increasingly specialised domains. Affixing their alignment to a field.
- Eventually the student will be satisfied they are ready to apply their skills to productive work.
- They will enter the workforce into a field which aligns with their character and ability and work over the remainder of their career to advance vertically within their chosen field. 
- Thus fulfilling their destiny.

#### Maximising Individual Specialist Model

- A model for design of educational programs in response to the Aligned Affixed Destiny model of personal development and it's intersection with 19th/20th century modes of productive activity.
- Oriented towards a mechanistic view of industry whereby workers are provisioned in terms of replicable components, specialised as required, crystallising in the form of the "job".
- Embeds the competitive nature of the jobs market.
- Isolates students by defining success purely in terms of their individual attainment.
- Obligates students to engage, to the fullest of their ability, in competition with their peers by nationally gaged standards, with a program which is imposed upon them, and to accept the consequences of their performance as measured only in terms of the criterion it deems correct.

Aetiology of The Crisis
-----------------------

### The Grading System

- An outgrowth of an education system conceived in terms of the models identified above.
- An attempt to simplify the complex branching transition phase of progression at the end of secondary education.  
- Adopts the role of categorising and sorting students in terms it deems appropriate to the needs of both industry and continued education.
- Forms a single gateway through which students must pass only at the end of their course of education.
- Captures very limited metrics and does so in a single pass.
- A single sample of a function which assumes a linear progression in all cases.
- Provides an algebra of student attainment.

### Predicted Grades

- As argued above, the grading system is a process by which we attempt to produce an impoverished measure of that resulting from a chaotic interplay of variables, of which we don't have a good understanding, predicated on a flawed model of attainment which assumes a linear progression in all cases.
- In the absence of the pivotal method of assessment we asked teachers to generate a specific and precise grade for each of their students, so as to conform to the expected output of the usual process, and to do so while accounting for their own internal biases.
- To maintain impartiality, we asked teachers to suppress their own self interest, upon which the model underlying their own advancement in the workforce is predicated, and their desire for their own students to be successful (a trait we should arguably be actively facilitating).
- Any data available to inform their predictions was not generated with the expectation to be employed in such a manner.

### Statistical/Aggregative Massaging

- Given that the teacher's predicted grades must be considered to lack accuracy, impartiality and uniformity of standard, a standardisation process, involving adjustment of some/all grades was deemed necessary.
- As argued above, aggregation of an individual students grades serves to further obfuscate the actual abilities of the student.
- Standardisation requires some form of aggregation across classes, subjects and/or schools. Reliability of the grades awarded to any individual student can only be reduced by such processing.
- Any processing performed across the set of predicated grades can only serve to further remove the individual grades from the truth of the situation on the ground. - There was never going to be a good way to do this (garbage in, garbage out). 

### The Coding Error

- In common language, a "coding error" suggests something sufficiently complex that errors can be expected to occur.
- This did not rise to the standard of a coding error.

Establishing A New Orientation
==============================

Components of Program Design
----------------------------

### Subject/Topic Substructure

- Most subjects some combination of:
  - Linear Accumulative
    - History
    - Geography
  - Compounding Accumulative
    - Mathematics
    - Science Theory
  - Applicative/Explorative
    - English
    - Literature
  - Skill Developmental
    - Art
    - Music
  - Practical
    - Science Practical
    - PE
__Different substructures suited to different mastery strategies.__

### Modes of provision:

- Directed provision: One-way mode where the form and content is present and statically delivered.
  - Textbook followed in linear progression.
  - Static exposition
    - Lecture
    - Presentation
- Guided provision (explorative): Multi-way mode of provision where the students are able to guide the delivery so as to address their interests and needs.
  - Textbook available for topic reference.
  - Searchable indexes.
  - Dynamic exposition:
    - Q&A session.
    - Tutorials.
    - Office hours.
- Self-Directed provision: Open access to directed forms of provision

__Different modes suited to different mastery strategies and subject/topic substructures.__

### Mastery

- Mastery: Attainment of a subject, topic or skill, to a level sufficient to apply the knowledge or ability gained in a productive, useful or novel way.
- Attainment: Demonstrable accumulated acquisition.
- Acquisition: 
  - Knowledge: Understanding and retention of information so as to be able to __apply it in relevant situations__.
  - Skill: Retained ability to apply a skill and to __recognise suitable opportunities to do so__.
- Mastery strategy: Strategy, or combination of, adopted by a student in order to maximise efficient acquisition.
  - Linear acquisition
  - Back loaded acquisition (cramming)
  - Frontloaded acquisition (binging)
  - Repeated spaced exposure

### Multidisciplinary

- Engaging a student with a topic or project with which they do not have familiarity encourages them to:
  - Identity and engage with other students and their teachers who have the tools to help or contribute.
  - Actively seek out and acquire the knowledge or skills they need.
  - Employ problem solving strategies and seek novel approaches to find solutions.
- Problems requiring a multidisciplinary approach allow students to practice:
  - Gathering and synthesising different kinds of information.
  - Recognising novel opportunities to apply skills and knowledge they have previously acquired.

### Collaboration

-

### Peer Supported Learning

-

New Models
----------
  
### Adaptive Total Personhood Model

- Understands the world to be continually complexifying at an increasing rate.
- Recognises remarkable human ability to respond to complexity and adapt to change.
  - Further how we do this is itself complex and adaptive.
- Models learning as an emergent capacity arising from our own complex nature.
- Views the proper response involves:
  - Creating space to facilitate discovery.
  - Allowing emergent responses to complexity to arise in diverse ways.
  - Seeking to identify when a student exhibits a strong response to some domain of complexity.

### Cohort Model

- Models education around creating successful cohorts.
  - Encourages students to succeed together.
- Prescribes placement of students so as to produce diverse cohorts.
  - Diverse in terms of ability as well as background.
	- Maximise the value of peer supported learning and collaboration.
  - Removes the achievement barrier to access to traditionally high barrier institutions.
- Recognises impact to outcomes at second level arising from individual backgrounds.
  - Allows students opportunity to overcome difficult backgrounds and establish their character as independently supported people before they are graded and classified.

Mastery Oriented Program
------------------------

A proposal for a new program for higher education, based on the models above, intended to alleviate the impact of the grades crisis while offering a better orientation for higher education for the future.

### Outline

- Based on recognition of student 'mastery' of 'topics'.
- Three components to topic mastery:
  - Participation in a course of learning centred around a particular topic.
    - Leading to a recognition of attainment in the topic.
  - Engagement in tutoring their peers in topics for which they have been awarded attainment.
    - When peers they tutor are awarded attainment, this contributes towards recognition of the students own mastery of the topic. 
  - Contribution to a project predicated on application of the knowledge and/or skills embedded in a topic for which they have been awarded attainment.
    - Leading to a recognition of mastery in the topic.
- Students engage with their education as:
  - Topic cohort members.
  - Topic tutors.
  - Project team members.

### Student Conference

- Students work towards progressively enhancing their own Student Conference.
- Student Conference: The collection of the attainment and mastery awards conferred to a student.
- Captures the higher order 'subject' mastery and 'generalised component aspect' mastery (see topic section below) conferred by the collection of topic awards.
- Represents students total educational achievement in terms of a unified ontology and framework.
- Students can contribute to their conference, with awards from any institution, over their lifetime.

### Facilitation

- Students can be supported by various mentors and facilitators at various levels of their engagement with education.
  - Personal mentor.
    - Each student can be assigned to a member of faculty to provide support and guidance throughout their education engagement.
  - Topic facilitators.
    - Each topic can be provisioned by one or more faculty staff who are available to support students in their interactions  and engagements as topic cohorts.
  - Topic domain experts.
    - Each topic can be backed by one or more faculty staff who have domain specific knowledge to:
      - Design the topic.
      - Produce and deliver it's content.
      - Be available to students for guidance, explanations and insights.
  - Project mentors.
    - Each project can be assigned one or more faculty staff who are available to support project teams.

Topics
------

- Topics are modelled as the intersection of:
  - Some prescribed domain of knowledge to be acquired.
  - Some particular set of skills to be acquired.
  - Some set of generalizable 'component aspects' embedded within the topic.
    - e.g.: Some topics related to various sciences may have an experimental component in common such that mastery of those topics could confer a mastery of 'scientific experimentation' as a qualification in it's own right.
  - The precedent knowledge and skills the topic builds upon.
  - The soft skills and strategies required to attain mastery of the topic.
  - _All are made explicit using the terms of a unified ontology._ 
- Topics serve to:
  - Disaggregate modules from subject courses.
  - Allow for new possibilities for integrated interdisciplinary packages of learning.
  - Make explicit all aspects of mastery needed for success so that we can achieve:
    - Fuller recognition of student competency involved in mastery.
    - More nuanced recognition of connections between topics. 
- Topics can:
  - Be designed as interdisciplinary collaborations between faculty and even between different universities.
  - Have other topics as precedents.
    - As opposed to prerequisites. With topics, if a student feels they can achieve mastery of the topic they can engage with it.
  - Be classified in terms of the difficulty and complexity of themselves and of their precedents.

### Open Access

- Any student can engage with any topic.
- Students choose topics not courses and are never required to choose a specialisation.
  - Students manage the overall shape of their Student Conference via the choosing of topics they commit to mastery of.
- Topic provision can be readily equipped to scale to meet demand.
- Creates a marketplace for topics where popular topics thrive as robust communities of engaged students.
  - Encourages topics to be popular rather than mitigating against over subscription to courses.
- Encourages experimentation and an adaptive approach to topic design and provision.

### Open Entry & Assessment

- A student can engage with a topic at any time.
- Topics regularly stage opportunities for assessment for attainment conference.
  - Students opt to be assessed when they believe they are ready to succeed.
  - Students can opt to be assessed as many times as they feel there is value in their continued attempts.
  - Recognises there is valuable information, for students and faculty, in failure and embraces it.
- Encourages topic cohorts to be made up of students at different stages of progression in the topic material at any given time.
  - Creates opportunity for greater effects of peer supported learning.

### Topic Provision

- Modelled after a combination of online courses + open source tech meetup/conference culture.
- Online Courses:
  - All structured topic content delivered as pre-recorded lectures and tutorials.
  - All learning materials are digital.
  - All content and learning materials available online, __open to anyone, including the public, for free, anytime, anywhere, no matter who you are.__
  - Students can choose any strategy they wish to absorb the material so as to get the most value from the in-person, face-to-face aspects of the topic provision.
    - Binge watch topic lectures.
    - Arrange their own scheduled mix of various topics together.
    - Absorb the material at home alone.
    - Enjoy it with friends and have discussions about it.
  - __Students can trial topics online before committing to attempt mastery.__ 
    - This will massively reduce wasted time and recourses for students who would otherwise have made massive commitments to a traditional course of study only to find they were ill suited to it.
- Open source tech inspired meetups and conferences:

Summary
-------

Hopefully the outcome of these detailed observations will be to recognise that we don’t need to employ an alternative program to maintain the existing grading scheme during this crisis. Indeed by seeing the flaws exposed by this crisis and acting to discard the scheme, along with its flawed assumptions and outdated models, we have an opportunity to fundamentally reorient education around the deeper richer understanding of personal development, productivity and success we have today. 

- As early as the 1950s/60s [Marshall McLuhan understood that the world of work was going to reorient from 'job holding' towards 'role playing'](https://youtu.be/mde_pXrEqBk). I propose we hear the echo of his words in the world around us today.

Tweetable Summary
-----------------

Grades are bullshit and everyone has known it for a long time. In a do or die world we all engage with the fight that's in front of us. Where the power to change the system rests with those who have been well served by it, radical change becomes a matter of response to crisis.
